# Simple Voice Chat

## Important Notes

You need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.
Without opening this port, the voice chat will not work.
This port can be changed in the server config.
More information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).

The voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own risk!
